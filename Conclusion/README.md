## Interpretation of the EDA results

- 51% of India's total land area is cultivated, in the present.
- Population density is on a constant increase with increase in time period.
- Due to the increase in population with time, the % of total country area cultivated has reduced by 0.7%
- On an average, water obtained through precipitation is the highest water resource which forms the 61% of the entire available water resources.
- Surface water forms 32% of total water resources and the rest 11% comprises of ground water.
- The available water resources tell us that India maintains a good atmospheric balance and areas with high amount of precipitation(rainfall)
can take advantage of extra water by harvesting it.
- Cultivated areas equipped for irrigation have greater chances of giving more harvest than areas cultivated upon ground water.
- Irrigation does'nt seem to impact crop intensity in agricultural water managed areas. So irrigating agricultural water managed area can be avoided.
- Area equipped for irrigation by surface water seems to have decreased cropping intensity. So, surface water is not a good resource for irrigation.
- Total harvested irrigated cropping area and irrigation cropping intensity linearly increase with time. Thus irrigation has aided crop production
as expected.
- Water management through irrigation must be priotirized, as irrigated areas have increased chances of water clogging and flood occurences.
- At the end, irrigation has always supported the Indian economy. The GDP per capita is upward throughout with increased agricutural production due to irrigation.
