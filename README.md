A dig into data and irrigation - Understanding India's Irrigation Potential through Exploratory Data Analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the first step in the data analysis process.  Here, I have explored the data obtained by querying  United Nation's AQUASTAT database. The AQUASTAT database is created by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. FAO offers data, metadata, reports, country profiles, river basin profiles, regional analyses, maps, tables, spatial data, guidelines, and other tools on:
- Water resources: internal, transboundary, total
- Water uses: by sector, by source, wastewater
- Irrigation: location, area, typology, technology, crops
- Dams: location, height, capacity, surface area
- Water-related institutions, policies and legistation

As a part of EDA, I have developed few visual methods to get a sense of India's Irrigation Potential.

The link to the AQUASTAT database can be found [here](http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/query/index.html).
The data that I have queried from the database for exploration is attached [here](https://github.com/HaripriyaTV/Dig-in-and-Hold-on/blob/master/asiaaquastat.csv).

Dig into my following contents and you would realise that Irrigation in India has to be held on.

1. [Introduction](https://github.com/HaripriyaTV/Dig-in-and-Hold-on/blob/master/Introduction.ipynb) (with [preliminary code](https://github.com/HaripriyaTV/Dig-in-and-Hold-on/blob/master/Preliminary_Code.ipynb))
2. [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](https://github.com/HaripriyaTV/Dig-in-and-Hold-on/blob/master/EDA_code.ipynb) comprising,
   - Exploration of land area and water resources in India
   - Assessment of land and water requirements for irrigation
   - Analysis on the existing information on irrigation and its potential
   - Identifying the impact of irrigation development on environment and economy
